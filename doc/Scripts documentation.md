###############################################################################
# make-glyco-paint-installer.sh
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Creates a cross-platform, self-extracting Glyco-PAINT installer that bundles
#   all desktop applications and the Fiji plugin into a single, portable script.
#
# USE CASE:
#   Run this script after building all Glyco-PAINT modules to produce a complete
#   installer that users can execute on macOS or Windows (via Git Bash).
#   The installer automatically locates or prompts for Fiji.app and installs the
#   appropriate plugin JAR, ensuring a ready-to-run environment.
#
# ACTIONS PERFORMED:
#   1  Detects operating system (macOS or Windows via Git Bash)
#   2  Gathers built .app bundles from:
#        ~/Applications/Glyco-PAINT/  (macOS)
#        ~/AppData/Local/Glyco-PAINT/ (Windows)
#   3  Finds the Fiji fat JAR automatically from:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/paint-fiji-plugin/target/
#   4  Packages the applications and JAR into a base64-encoded, self-extracting
#      Bash installer script located in:
#        ~/Downloads/Glyco-PAINT-Installer.sh
#   5  The generated installer:
#        ‚Ä¢ Installs Glyco-PAINT into the user‚Äôs Applications folder
#        ‚Ä¢ Detects or prompts for Fiji.app location
#        ‚Ä¢ Copies the Fiji plugin JAR into Fiji‚Äôs plugins directory
#
# USAGE:
#   chmod +x make-glyco-paint-installer.sh
#   ./make-glyco-paint-installer.sh
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - macOS or Windows (Git Bash)
#   - tar, base64, and standard Unix utilities available on PATH
#   - Fiji plugin already built (fat JAR must exist in `paint-fiji-plugin/target`)
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
#   - Exits if required directories or JARs are missing
#   - Creates temporary workspace safely via `mktemp`
#   - Cleans up intermediate files automatically
#
# RESULT:
#   - Self-contained Bash installer at:
#       ~/Downloads/Glyco-PAINT-Installer.sh
#   - When executed, installs:
#       ‚Ä¢ Glyco-PAINT applications ‚Üí ~/Applications/Glyco-PAINT/
#       ‚Ä¢ Fiji plugin ‚Üí Fiji.app/plugins/
#
# WHERE TO CHECK RESULTS:
#   üîπ Installer Script:
#        ~/Downloads/Glyco-PAINT-Installer.sh
#
#   üîπ Installed Applications:
#        ~/Applications/Glyco-PAINT/              (macOS)
#        ~/AppData/Local/Glyco-PAINT/            (Windows)

### Make Icons


```
###############################################################################
# make-icons.sh
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Unified icon generation script for all Glyco-PAINT desktop applications.
#   Converts high-resolution PNG source images into platform-specific icons
#   (.icns for macOS, .ico for Windows) and installs them into each module‚Äôs
#   resource directory for packaging.
#
# USE CASE:
#   Run this script whenever PNG icon artwork changes. It rebuilds all required
#   app icons for macOS and Windows automatically and places them in the proper
#   module resource locations.
#
# ACTIONS PERFORMED:
#   1  Scans the source directory:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/paint-icons-generation/
#   2  For each 1024√ó1024 PNG file found:
#        ‚Ä¢ Creates a macOS .iconset directory
#        ‚Ä¢ Uses `sips` and `iconutil` to generate a .icns bundle
#        ‚Ä¢ Optionally uses ImageMagick `convert` to generate a .ico file
#   3  Copies both icon types into each module‚Äôs resource directory:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/<module>/src/main/resources/icons/
#
# SUPPORTED MODULES:
#   ‚Ä¢ paint-generate-squares
#   ‚Ä¢ paint-create-experiment
#   ‚Ä¢ paint-get-omero
#   ‚Ä¢ paint-viewer
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - macOS system (for `sips` and `iconutil`)
#   - ImageMagick (optional, for .ico generation)
#       ‚Üí install via: brew install imagemagick
#
# USAGE:
#   chmod +x make-icons.sh
#   ./make-icons.sh
#
# RESULT:
#   Each module‚Äôs `src/main/resources/icons/` directory will contain:
#     ‚Ä¢ paint-<app>.icns  ‚Äî used for macOS .app bundles
#     ‚Ä¢ paint-<app>.ico   ‚Äî used for Windows .exe packaging (if ImageMagick found)
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
#   - Exits early if source directory not found
#   - Skips copy for unknown base names
#   - Gracefully handles missing ImageMagick dependency
#
# WHERE TO CHECK RESULTS:
#   üîπ macOS icon bundles:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/<module>/src/main/resources/icons/*.icns
#   üîπ Windows icon files:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/<module>/src/main/resources/icons/*.ico
#   üîπ PNG source files:
#        ~/JavaPaintProjects/paint-icons-generation/

# PURPOSE:
#   Builds and publishes the Maven-generated documentation site (target/site)
#   to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, which serves GitHub Pages.
#
# USE CASE:
#   Run this script after tagging or releasing a new version. It safely rebuilds
#   and deploys the Maven site without disturbing your main working tree or
#   local branches.
#
# ACTIONS PERFORMED:
#   1  Detects project root automatically (can run from anywhere)
#   2  Removes any stale `gh-pages` worktree or branch
#   3  Builds Maven site if missing (`mvn clean site`)
#   4  Creates a temporary worktree for the `gh-pages` branch
#   5  Copies site files from `target/site` into the worktree
#   6  Commits and pushes changes to GitHub Pages
#   7  Cleans up all temporary files and worktrees
#
# FEATURES:
#   ‚Ä¢ Fully self-contained ‚Äî no external dependencies beyond Git + Maven
#   ‚Ä¢ Safe ‚Äî never modifies your main working tree
#   ‚Ä¢ Idempotent ‚Äî does nothing if no site changes are detected
#
