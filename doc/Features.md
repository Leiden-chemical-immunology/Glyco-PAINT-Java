# Release notes PAINT-App in Java



1. **Fully Rewritten in Java for Improved Performance**

   All core logic has been reimplemented in Java, replacing older scripting components. This shift enables more efficient execution and better integration with modern Java tooling.

2. **Complete Redesign for Maintainability and Clarity**

   The system has been refactored from the ground up, removing legacy artifacts and outdated designs. The result is a more coherent, maintainable, and future-proof codebase.

3. **Modern Plugin Architecture with Fiji Update Support**

   The PAINT Fiji plugin is now a standard Java plugin, distributed via two JAR files. It supports automatic updates through Fiji’s built-in update mechanism, simplifying installation and maintenance for end users.

4. **Standalone Applications for Key Tools**

   Tools such as *Generate Squares* are now delivered as self-contained desktop applications, runnable independently of Fiji or any development environment.

5. **Clear Separation of User and Developer Roles**

   End users no longer need access to development tools. A clean separation between usage and development streamlines deployment. Full source code remains openly available via [GitHub](https://github.com/) for transparency and contribution.

6. **Extensive Documentation via JavaDoc**

   The entire codebase is thoroughly documented using the JavaDoc system, offering detailed insights into each component’s purpose and usage.

7. **Streamlined Workflow**

   The user workflow has been significantly simplified and now follows three straightforward steps:

   - Run the TrackMate plugin
   - Generate Squares
   - Analyze data in R (or another statistical environment)

8. **Unified, Simplified User Interface**

   The graphical user interface is now consistent across all tools, including the TrackMate plugin and the Generate Squares app, reducing the learning curve and improving user experience.

9. **Configurable via Project-Specific Settings**

   Flexibility is enhanced by allowing each project to define its own configuration using Paint Configuration files, enabling fine-tuned, reproducible analysis pipelines.

10. **Optimized Data Formats**

    CSV file formats have been simplified by removing obsolete fields and reducing redundancy. This leads to file sizes up to 50% smaller compared to previous versions.

    ⚠️ *Note: existing analysis scripts (e.g., in R) require updates to accommodate the new format.*

11. **Robust Pre-Execution Validation**

    Comprehensive validation mechanisms detect potential configuration or data issues before execution begins, reducing runtime failures and improving reliability.

12. **Defensive Programming for Fast Error Resolution**

    Extensive error checking and structured exception handling ensure that runtime problems are clearly reported, facilitating efficient debugging and support
